      hese are short, famous texts in English from classic sources like the
      Bible or Shakespeare. Some texts have word definitions and explanations to
      help you. Some of these texts are written in an old style of English. Try
      to understand them, because the English that we speak today is based on
      what our great, great, great, great grandparents spoke before! Of course,
      not all these texts were originally written in English. The Bible, for
      example, is a translation. But they are all well known in English today,
      and many of them express beautiful thoughts.
